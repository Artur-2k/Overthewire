A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

In this level we can go to the cronjob configuration folder and look at the folder for bandit22 and we can see that it executes a script every minute that uses cat on a tmp file with the password from bandit22
