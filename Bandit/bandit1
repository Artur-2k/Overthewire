 Dashed filenames

 Dash has a special meaning depending on context and a dashed filename could be missinterpreted.
 To solve this problem we have some ways to go around those special meanings
 We could use the path to the file (/path/still/path/- or ./-), use commands that don't create these types of conflicts (like more, for example)

ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

 cat ./-
 more -

 Either one of these commands will provide the password for the next level
