In this level we are given a ssh private key and the password is stored in the /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14
That means we have to connect to bandit14 using the private key that was given

checking the home directory we see the private key and using ssh with the flag -i we can connect using the private key

ssh -i ./sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220

more /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
