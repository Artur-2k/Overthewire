In this level we will have to look for a directory named inhere and look for the password in a hidden file

To look for hidden files we can use ls with the option -a to show all files and we can check the file ...Hiding-From-You is there
Then we just need to read it's content to get the password

ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

cd inhere
ls -a
cat ...Hiding-From-You

password:
