To solve this level we now have to do the samething but instead of looking in the inhere directory we will have to look in the entire server for a file with the following properties:


    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

We will use the same command as before with some different options now

ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size33 2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied"
more /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

password:
morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

Note to self: 2>&1 (>& = "redirect to") will redirect the stderr to stdout so we can filter out the permission denined errors on find with grep.
