To solve this level we will need to check the only line of text on the file data.txt that only occurs once

For that we will use the sort and uniq commands
We need sort because uniq only filters adjacent lines so they have to be sorted for uniq to work

ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

sort data.txt | uniq -u
