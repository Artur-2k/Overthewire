A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.


the same way as the level before cronjob creates a file every minute with the password for the next level. that file is an encoded message on /tmp so knowing its path we can read its content

if we try to read the password file we won't have permissions but that copy on tmp we can


cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh


echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1

bandit22@bandit:/tmp/tmp.s5Jd0GHheC$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
