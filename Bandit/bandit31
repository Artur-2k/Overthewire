we connect the same way as before aswell

git clone ssh://bandi31-git@localhost:2220/home/bandi31-git/repo
cd repo

cat README.md
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

cat .gitignore
*.txt

In this file were told to push a file named key.txt with some string on its content on the master branch

looking on the repo there is a .gitignore that ignores all .txt files
so removing the .gitignore and adding a file with the correct content and pushing it should solve the level

git checkout master
rm .gitignore
echo "May I come in?" > key.txt
git add key.txt
git commit -m"push"
git push
