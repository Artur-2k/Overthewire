In this level we will have to decompress a file that has been compressed mulitple times with multiple tools such as tar, gzip and bzip2

The first stage of the file is an hexdump of the compressed file
Before starting we can use the /temp file to create a temporary working directory using mktemp

ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


mktemp -d /temp/XXX
And then copy data.txt to that new temporary directory and start working there

So first, we can use the command xxd with the option -r to reverse this hexdump and redirect it to a new file so we can inspect that new file.

xxd -r data.txt >data
file data

And then from here on out we can use the decompressing tools to get the next stage of the data we want to see

commands used:

// for the extionsions needed
mv data data.tar
mv data data.gz
mv data data.bz2

tar -xvf data.tar
gzip -d data.gz
bzip2 -d data.bz2

After a while we will see that the file has ASCII text and that we can read the password for the next level
