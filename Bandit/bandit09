In this level we will have to look for the password in the contents of data.txt
The password is next to a n number of equals.
The contents of data have a lot of non readable characters

To solve this problem we can use the strings command that filters the human-readable contents and piping it's output to grep and find a match for any number of equals to get that FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey

ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


strings data.txt | grep "=.*"
strings data.txt | grep '=\{2,\}' // since it says "preceded by several ‘=’ characters." we can assume it's more than two and filter out the secret message with this regex too

password:
FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey

Note to self: Regular expression
=.* means:
	=: This matches the literal equals sign character. It looks for an = in the string.
	.: This matches any single character (except for a newline).
	*: This is a quantifier that means "zero or more" of the preceding element. In this case, it means "zero or more of any character."

=\{2,\} means:
=: This matches the literal equals sign (=) character.
\{2,\}: This is a quantifier that modifies the preceding character or group (in this case, the equals sign =). The \{2,\} means "match the preceding character 2 or more times":
	\{ and \}: These curly braces are used for quantifying in regular expressions.
    2,: This means the pattern should match at least 2 occurrences (and it can match more than 2).
