For this level we had to connect withing the level before machine using ssh and a private ssh key that was given on level 13

We will then have to send to localhost on port 30000 the password of the current level and it will feed us the password for the next


ssh -i ./sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

nc localhost 30000
