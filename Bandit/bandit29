we connect the same way as before aswell

git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo
cd repo

reading the contents of the readme.md file we can see that there might be other branches

so we can check for branches

git branch -r  (-r -> remote)
and we see one named dev
so if we switch to it we can read the contents now and it will get us the password

git checkout origin/dev
