In this level we will have to look for a file in the inhere directory that has the folloing proprieties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

Looking inside the folder we see we have a lot of sub directories with each one having multiple files so looking one by one isn't optimal.
We now can use the command find to look for matches using the proprieties they gave us

ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

cd inhere
ls -la
find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} \; | grep "ASCII text"
more ./maybehere07/.file2

Notes for self:
-exec file {} \; | grep "ASCII text"
-exec lets find execute a command (file) and each corresponding file will be put on the place of the placeholder {}. The \; will tell the end of the command (\ is necessary so shell doesn't interpret it as a special character)
