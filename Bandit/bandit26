on this level as soon as we enter the level we are logged out before we can even do anything

we are asked to check what shell they are using as it is not a common shell program and to try to break out of it

to check what shell is being used we can check on the /etc/passwd file

cat /etc/passwd |grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext

cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

exec more ~/text.txt
exit 0


here we can see that the shell being used is a showtext script that uses more to show a text prompt with more and then closes

The trick to this one is to think outside the box and just adjust your terminal to a size that uses more pagination feature so it keeps it locked on more and doesnt immidiatly close
after resizing the window we connect to bandit26 again and now we are still logged in
now to break out of this script that is stuck on more page1 we can use the vi feature on more (v) and execute a enviorment variable change (the shell) and change it to bash

*resizing*
v - for vi
:set shell=/usr/bin/bash
:shell for a subshell
and then we break out of that script and can move around and get the next level password with the setuid bin that is given

./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
