To solve this level we need to open the contents of a file named "spaces in this filename".
The trick for this one is just to interpret the spaces in the filename as literal spaces and not as a token separator

There are a few ways to go around this problem.
Quoting: quoting will expand regular spaces into it's literal form so spaces won't be used to tokenize this filename
Backslash: \ is an escape character that is used to include special characters reserved for some functionality (such as a token separator in case of spaces)

cat "spaces in this filename"
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
